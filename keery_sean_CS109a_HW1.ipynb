In the histograms of (both Marker 1 and Marker 2) for children, it is very clear that the distributions are bimodal. The children dataset falls into two distinct groups for each Marker 1 & 2 biometric. It's unclear if the subgrouping by the two markers are the same or different.  The histograms of (both Marker 1 and Marker 2) for adult women, the distributions looks unimodal. The histogram of Marker 1 for adult men also looks unimodal, while the histogram of Marker 2 for adult men looks bimodal\n",
    "Scatter Plots\n",
    "It appears that the overall dataset has four disease subtypes, however, all four are present only in children. There are only two subtypes present for adult women and three for adult men.  \n",
    "The scatter plot (color code by disease subtype) for the entire dataset has no clear separation between the data points in the different subtypes.\n",
    "The scatter plot for the children dataset has points in the different subtypes that are well separated. Points for each subtypes form spherical clusters and are concentrated around a \"center\".\n",
    "The scatter plot for the adult female dataset has points, in the different subtypes, that form clusters.  Those clusters are separated and are crescent shaped.\n",
    "The scatter plot for the adult male dataset also forms clusters. Two of the clusters are overlapping.\n",
    "Comparison of Visualizations and Stats\n",
    "The modes in the histogram correspond to clustering of the biometric data by disease subtype.\n",
    "Using the histogram alone, we cannot necessarily deduce the distribution of the scatter plots.\n",
    "Using the histograms alone, we cannot deduce clustering by disease subtypes. The modes in the histogram tell us where the data is concentrated along which axis, but they cannot tell us which disease subtypes exist in each mode.\n",
    "The stats we calculated for the entire dataset also give no indication of the patterns we see in the scatter plots.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "By looking at the data one demographic group at a time, then, for all demographic groups, we can identify clusters of disease type.  Those clusters are well separated for children along both the Marker 1 and Marker 2 axes. The separation is not so clear for the other two groups."
